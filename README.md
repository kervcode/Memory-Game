# Memory Game Project

This project is the second projects that I had to work on for the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree of Udacity. The project is a browser card matching game with 4x4 grid display. 

Here is an image of the game when it loads.

In this project, I learned how to manipulate the DOM.
