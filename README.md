# Memory Game Project

This project is the second projects that I had to work on for the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree of Udacity. The project is a browser card matching game with 4x4 grid display. 

# Game objective

Each cards a hidden matching image. User has to all the matching cards. User will first turn one card then will click on another card turn it and reveal its image. If the images in both card matched, the card will stay in the revealing state. If they do not match, the cards will turn back to the hidden state. That is the reason behind the *MEMERY GAME* name. User needs to remember the position of the previously revealed card to be able to find all matchs.

# Game Features
- Has a timer that keeps control of how long it takes a user to win the game.
- Has a star rating that gives a visual indication of the user's performance throughout the game. 
- Has counter that keeps tab of how many move the user makes.
- Has a refresh button that will start a new Game.

# Game Start
- User clicks on any of the cards to initiate the game. After the first card is revealed, the timer and the move counter will start incrememting. The star rating will decrement by one star after each 8 moves.

# Game End
- When a user won the game, a modal shows up with stats letting the user know how long it take to win the game, how many stars the user have left, and how many moves it took to win the game. 

Here is an image of the game when it loads.
